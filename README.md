# Negative-Power-Series
Algebraic operations with power series. It allows for manipulation of terms with negative exponents.

Infinite polynomials, with a bounded precision. It supports addition, multiplication, subtraction, division (when the leading term is 1 or -1; this can be changed easily, but this way the coefficients will always be integers) and multiplication by scalars.

This will not be effective if the computations are with mere polynomials.
